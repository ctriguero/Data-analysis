(1)	From lammps file out.lammps we can crop the size of the simulation box as a function of the time step.
	This can be easily done with in escape mode: vi CTRL v select the columns and then CTRL G to go to the final then 		press d to delete. We build the file Leave also the time step column to synchronize with trajectory that is usually 		less frequently saved.

	box.data

(2)	Now in the trajectory file xyz we have to replace the command line by the box size. Plumed will interpret correctly 		this numbers.
	To be cleaner we can remove the comment line information by doing
	sed -i 's/^At.*//g' traj_all.xyz
